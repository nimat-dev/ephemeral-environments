# CHANGELOG — completed implementation, with evidence

Newest first. One entry per feature that reached `COMPLETE`. An entry is not valid without
reproducible evidence (see `verification/acceptance-evidence.md`).

## Template
```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <FID> <feature name> — COMPLETE
Branch/commit: <branch> @ <sha>   PR: <url>   CI: <green + link>
Evidence:
  - <exact command> -> <result / test id / artifact path>
  - full suite: <command> -> <N passed, 0 failed> (no regressions)
  - e2e: <command> -> <scenarios passed / N-A not user-facing> (trace: .harness/evidence/<FID>/)
  - edge cases: <the applicable edge-cases.md categories covered, by test>
Evaluator: acceptance=_ correctness=_ boundaries=_ modularity=_ evidence=_ => avg _._  (PASS)
Notes: <anything the next agent should know>
```
