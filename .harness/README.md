# Project Harness

This is the **harness** for building this project. A harness gives the model a closed-loop
working system so it builds the right thing, verifies its own work, and — through the
persistent tracking system below — survives across sessions without relying on
conversation history.

**There is no application code here.** This folder is a persistent tracking system +
rules + specs. A coding agent reads it, then writes the app one verified feature at a time.

## The requirement
`preview-environments-implementation.md` — the source spec: per-branch AKS preview
environments with idle scale-to-zero (KEDA HTTP add-on), wake-on-request, wildcard DNS/TLS,
and dispatch-driven GitHub Actions deploy/destroy/reap. Every harness file below is derived
from it; for exact file contents, the spec wins.

## Read order (every session starts here)
1. `PROJECT_STATE.md` — **MASTER FILE.** Where the project is. Read this before anything.
2. `CURRENT_TASK.md` — the one feature to work on next.
3. `ROADMAP.md` — all features across the phases, with status.
4. The active `phases/PHASE-XX-*.md` — acceptance criteria.
5. `DECISIONS.md` + `BLOCKERS.md`, then inspect the real code.

## The tracking system (why it exists)
The project must not depend on chat history to know what's done. `PROJECT_STATE.md`
answers "where am I?", `ROADMAP.md` answers "where am I going?", `CURRENT_TASK.md`
answers "what do I do now?". After implementing and verifying, the agent updates the
tracking files and picks the next task. A brand-new session can enter the repo and
continue with no prior context.

## The idea in one line
Rules-first entry points (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`rules/`), an agent-readable workspace
(this tree), multi-session continuity (the tracking files), runtime feedback + scope
control (`rules/` + `scripts/`), self-verification + role separation (`verification/`),
automated loops (`loops/`), and the workflow drawn as a graph (`graph/`).
